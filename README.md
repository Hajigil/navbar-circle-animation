The word "MENU" was added under the lowest line in the hamburger menu icon. The word is clickable. 
A line above the word MENU occurs and I tried to overlap it with the lowest line of the hamburger.
Still the line appears to be thicker that other two above. 
Need to make a modification to remove mouse over effect from the word "MENU" and get rid of the extra line.
